# Code for Learning Prediction Functions of the Prior Measure

## Overview
1. Directory ***core*** contains the main functions and classes that are useful for implementing the algorithms. Specifically,
- probability.py: This file contains classes of GaussianElliptic2[The Gaussian measure implemented by finite element methods based on solving elliptic differential equations used for generating samples and also contains the functionality of evaluate the gradient and Hessian operators];
GaussianFiniteRank[The Gaussian measure implemented by finite element methods and eigensystem decomposition].
- noise.py: This file contains the class NoiseGaussianIID.
- model.py: This file contains the class Domain and two classes Domain2D and Domain1D inherits from the parent class Domain; contains the parent class ModelBase of the model classes employed in specific examples, the class ModelBase incoporate the components of domain, prior, equation solver, and noise. 
- linear_eq_solver.py: contains the function cg_my which is our implementation of the conjugate gradient algorithm for solving linear equations. 
- eigensystem.py: This file contains the function double_pass which is our implementation of an algorithm for calculating eigensystem. 
- approximate_sample.py: This file contains the class LaplaceApproximate, which can be used for computate the Laplace approximation of the posterior measures. 
- optimizer.py: This file contains the class OptimBase[incoporate an implementation of armijo_line_search can be employed for each optimizer]; the class GradientDescent[an implementation of the gradient descent algorithm]; the class NewtonCG[an implementation of the Newton conjugate gradient algorithm]. 
- sample.py: This file contatins the class pCN, which is a type of discrete invariant Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling algorithm. 
- Plotting.py: This file contains some functions that can draw functions generated by FEniCS. 
- misc.py: This file contains functions of trans2spnumpy, trans2sptorch, spnumpy2sptorch, sptorch2spnumpy, and sptensor2cude, which will be useful for transfering sparse matrixes to different forms required for doing calculations in numpy, pytorch, and FEniCS. This file also contatins the function construct_measurement_matrix, which will be used for generating a sparse matrix S. The matrix S tims a function generated by FEniCS with get the values at the measurement points.
